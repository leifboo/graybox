GrayBox was an attempt to run vintage Mac apps on Mac OS X... without "Classic". Unfortunately, this project requires a PowerPC processor. It is nontrivial to update it, as it also requires the Carbon framework, which is not present on modern Macs.

GrayBox is similar to Apple's BlueBox/Classic. Like Classic, GrayBox interleaves its windows as peers to those of native apps. Unlike Classic, GrayBox runs each app in its own protected memory space.

GrayBox runs only early B&W apps. Currently, it has been tested only with MacDraw 1.9.5; see http://www.dejamac.com/software/macdraw/.

It uses Mini vMac's M68K emulator by Bernd Schmidt and Paul Pratt; see http://minivmac.sourceforge.net/.
